ðŸ“– About
This repository contains a collection of quantum computing projects developed using frameworks like Qiskit. Each project demonstrates a unique application of quantum algorithms in areas such as:

Quantum- Circuit


Quantum machine learning (QML)

Quantum chemistry simulation

Optimization using quantum algorithms (e.g., QAOA)

Quantum data encoding and feature maps

Quantum-classical hybrid models

The projects serve as both learning tools and exploratory implementations aimed at understanding the capabilities and limitations of near-term quantum computers.

ðŸ”¬ Whether you're a beginner exploring qubits or an enthusiast experimenting with variational algorithms, this repo offers a range of use cases in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era.
